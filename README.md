# Godot Code::Stats Plugin

This is my custom Code::Stats Plugin for Godot.

To use this addon, a custom build Godot is required with all of the patches from the patches folder applied before compilation.

When a custom patched Godot is used, the addons folder can be copied to a Godot project, the Access Token set and enabled.
